**Best way to beautify and clean up your hierarchy window. Easy to use. and so much more...**

To use colored folders, you can add one by 
* Selecting it from `GameObject` menu at `GameObject > ThisSome1 > Colorful Hierarchy > Colored Folder`.
* Selecting it from context menu by right-clickig in the hierarchy window `ThisSome1 > Colorful Hierarchy > Colored Folder`.
* Rename any GameObject to follow bellow pattern, and it automatically turns into a ColoredFolder.<br>Name Pattern: `\\ [Name]`

**REMEMBER**:
A folder can't have any components and transform overrides and will be removed
when building the project.

Remove components before converting GameObject to a folder.
