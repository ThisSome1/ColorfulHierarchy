** Best way to beautify and clean up your hierarchy window. Easy to use. and so much more...**

To use colored folder, you can simply rename any GameObject to follow bellow pattern,
and it automatically turns into a ColoredFolder. Or adding it from GameObject menu at GameObject/ThisSome1/Colored Folder.
Name Pattern: \\ [Name]

REMEMBER:
A folder can't have any components and transform overrides and will be removed
when building the project.

Remove components before making GameObject a folder.
